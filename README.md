# DallasAirbnb

Airbnb is a service that allows customers to book a stay at a property listed by a host. Hosts may list any type of property, from a room in their home to an entire house. For this project, I'm investigating factors that influence prices of Airbnb listings.

Through this project, I've demonstrated my professional curiosity in the following ways:
* Sourcing data (check out Inside Airbnb [here](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), I used the data from 16 April, 2025).
* Cleaning, wrangling, and merging my data (listing and calendar datasets) using Python (pandas, NumPy)
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using multiple visualizations (seaborn, matplotlib)
* Generating hypotheses and testing via machine learning (regression, K-means)
* Time series analysis of property values in Dallas for comparison

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the financial advantages of becoming an Airbnb host in the Dallas area. I was able to identify a clear indicator driving up the value of an Airbnb listing. I also discovered that certain factors did not affect prices in the way I expected. To find out more, see my Tableau storyboard **Here**
