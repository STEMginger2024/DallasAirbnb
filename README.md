# DallasAirbnb

Airbnb is a service that allows customers to book a stay at a property listed by a host. Hosts may list any type of property, from a room in their home to an entire house. For this project, I'm investigating factors that influence prices of Airbnb listings.

Through this project, I've demonstrated my professional curiosity in the following ways:
* Sourcing data (check out Inside Airbnb [here](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), I used the data from 16 April, 2025).
* Cleaning, wrangling, and merging my data (listing and calendar datasets) using Python (pandas, NumPy)
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using multiple visualizations (seaborn, matplotlib)
* Generating hypotheses and testing via machine learning (regression, K-means)

The goal of the project was to determine factors a customer might take into consideration when choosing an Airbnb to book, and which of those factors would impact pricing. I created a Tableau storyboard to demonstrate my findings, which you can view [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/QMPMBX249?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)!
